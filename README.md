# Homelab Infrastructure as Code

This repository contains the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) configurations for my personal homelab environment. It uses a combination of Ansible, Terraform, and Docker Compose to manage and deploy various services.

## 🏗 Infrastructure Overview

The infrastructure is managed using three main technologies:
- **Ansible**: For configuration management and automated system setup
- **Terraform**: For infrastructure provisioning
- **Docker Compose**: For containerized application deployment

For running my terraform code and my ansible playbooks I am currently using semaphore UI.
